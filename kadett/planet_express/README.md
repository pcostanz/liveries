File: You'll want to move the `kad_tex_high_16.pssg` file, as you can see, I've chosen to overwrite `livery_016/textures_high` which is the second one of the 8 that you can choose for the car. You can easily rename this file and overwrite any other livery for the car.

### Opel Kadett

#### Planet Express
