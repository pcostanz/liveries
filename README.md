# Dirt Rally Liveries

This is a repository of custom car models that I have created for [DiRT Rally](http://dirtgame.com/). There is no car editor for this game, all of this is custom work done in Photoshop.

## Instructions

In the top right, you can download all of the liveries in this repository
by pressing "Download ZIP".

To Install liveries, you will need to overwrite existing game liveries located
in your Dirt Rally installation game files.

These are usually located in : {YOUR_STUFF}\Steam\SteamApps\common\DiRT Rally\cars\models

Each individual folder should have another readme containing information regarding how to
identify the folder name that the livery goes with.
